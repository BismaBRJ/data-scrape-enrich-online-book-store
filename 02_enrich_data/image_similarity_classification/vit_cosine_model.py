"""
This file defines the overall structure of my
image similarity classification model:
a ViT (Vision Transformer) for vector embeddings/encoding,
followed by the calculation of cosine similarity.
Later the threshold is determined with
either the ROC curve or the Precision-Recall curve.

Possible error I know of:
Something something SSL certificate, preceded by something like
Downloading: "https://download.pytorch.org/models/vit_b_32-d86f8d99.pth"
to [some directory]
Solution: manually download that file and move it to that directory
(funny to think PyTorch of all organizations can have expired SSL certificates)
